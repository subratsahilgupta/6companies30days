// You are given an integer matrix isWater of size m x n that represents a map of land and water cells.

// If isWater[i][j] == 0, cell (i, j) is a land cell.
// If isWater[i][j] == 1, cell (i, j) is a water cell.
// You must assign each cell a height in a way that follows these rules:

// The height of each cell must be non-negative.
// If the cell is a water cell, its height must be 0.
// Any two adjacent cells must have an absolute height difference of at most 1. A cell is adjacent to another cell if the former is directly north, east, south, or west of the latter (i.e., their sides are touching).
// Find an assignment of heights such that the maximum height in the matrix is maximized.

// Return an integer matrix height of size m x n where height[i][j] is cell (i, j)'s height. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

 

// Example 1:

// example1 mapofHighestpeak.png

// Input: isWater = [[0,1],[0,0]]
// Output: [[1,0],[2,1]]
// Explanation: The image shows the assigned heights of each cell.
// The blue cell is the water cell, and the green cells are the land cells.
// Example 2:

// example1 mapofHighestpeak.png

// Input: isWater = [[0,0,1],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]
// Output: [[1,1,0],[0,1,1],[1,2,2]]
// Explanation: A height of 2 is the maximum possible height of any assignment.
// Any height assignment that has a maximum height of 2 while still meeting the rules will also be accepted.
 

// Constraints:

// m == isWater.length
// n == isWater[i].length
// 1 <= m, n <= 1000
// isWater[i][j] is 0 or 1.
// There is at least one water cell.
